No cleaning is needed.\n- sales_method: there were 23 \"em + call\" values which need to be change to \"Email + Call\" sales method. Plus, there was inconsistent format of Email method (\"email\" and \"Email\") which need to be change to capitalise first letter format as supposed to have 3 sales methods in total.\n- customer_id: 15000 unique customer ids without any missing values, same as the description.

As for the sales method, approximately half of total customers were purchased by Email method which had biggest customer group comparing with the other two methods. On the contrary, the Email+Call approach helped less than 2300 customers to buy the products, which was only 1/3 of customers purchased by Email method. Last, the Call method triggered about 5000 customers for purchasing the new products which was ranked as the second powerful sales method. \n\n![image-9](image-9.png)\n\n## What does the spread of the revenue look like overall?\n### Distribution of overall revenue (number of clients)\n\nRegrarding the distribution of overall revenue for client perspective, the range of revenue per customer was from  32.54 to 238.32. The revenue difference was 200 which was in reasonable range. It may not have any outliers. Then, we categorised as four revenue group base on the revenue records from low,medium to high. As shown from the graph, the largest number of customers (6400) who generated revenue about from 80 to 130 (B revenue group). And there were 5400 customers who bought products worth from 30 to 80 (A revenue group). Last, the other two high revenue groups- C (130-180) and D (180-230) represented only 1200 and 900 clients respectively which was only 1/5 of B (80-30) group. \n\n![image-19](image-19.png)\n\n### Distribution of overall revenue\nAs for the spread of total revenue, we also used four categorised groups for better clarity. The B (80-130) group took the first place and generated 0.63 million revenue which is more than three times higher than other three groups. And revenue of the all other three groups- A(30-80), C(130-180) and D(180-230) were around 0.2-0.3 million. Despite the A groups contained fairly high number of customers in the previous section, but the revenue group was quite low. So the gap between A and B group was getting bigger and closer to those high revenue groups (C and D). That is the difference between two overall revenue distributions.\n\n![image-18](image-18.png)\n\n## What does the spread of the revenue look like for each method?\n### Distribution of revenue by sales method\n\nAccording to the bar chart as below, the revenue which triggered by Email method(0.67 million) took the lead among the three sales method within 6 weeks. Next, Email + Call method that generated 0.41 million revenue was only 2/3 of revenue by Email method. Last, the Call method was shown the third place(0.23 million) of three sales method which was only 1/3 of revenue of Email approach. Therefore, the Email method might be considered as most profitable method comparing with other two methods.\n\n![image-12](image-12.png)\n\n### Distribution of revenue by group & sales method\n\nIf we dive deeper about the sales records by revenue group and sales method. It was clear shown that the call method produced the majortity of low revenue orders (A group). The vast majority of medium orders (B group) were via Email method. And the Email + Call method took the other two high revenue groups (C and D group).\n\n![image-13](image-13.png)\n\n## Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?\n\nAt this stage, we focus on the revenue trend by each sale approach over these 6 weeks. First, the revenue of Email method reach the top point at the first week. And then the number decreased gradually for the following 5 weeks which reach the bottom point on the last week. However, the revenue which produced by Email + Call method increased from week 1 to week 5 and then declined slightly at last week. Last, the revenue of Call method remain almost stable within 6 weeks. \n\nThat can be summarised that **efficiency of Email method** was competitively high which completed most of orders at early stage. On the contrary, the Email + Call method was much slower for generating the real revenue which needed to wait 5 weeks for sales peak. \n\n![image-15](image-15.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6897c913-4cd0-49fc-8130-d5fe8e485def"},{"source":"## Business Metrics\n\nAs for the selection of sales method. We need to consider two elements- **profitablity and efficiency**. Therefore, we build up the **\"productivity by each sales methods\" metrics** that can help us to select which sales method was recommended. The caculation of this metrcis is total revenue of each sales method divided by week.\n\nBase on the last 6 weeks sales record, **the Email method** took 67% of total productivity which was recommended sales method. So if one of the productivity of sales method higher than other methods in the following weeks, then this method should be chosen.\n\n![image](image.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"760bc10e-9d02-46fa-9024-ddb6d5e8b153"},{"source":"## Recommendation\n\nFor the following weeks, we would recommend we can focus on the following steps:\n\n- Using key metrics to monitor productivity of each sales method to decide which method would be majorly continue to use.\n- Consider to drop the Call method due to the lowest productivity and also take much more time to process.\n- Integrate the Email and Email + Call sales method:\n    - Email all the previous and potential customers by using Email method.\n    - After two emails, we can focus those customers who have further reply or questions by making a short call to give more details about products (new Email + Call method including two emails and one call).\n- Data collection for in-depth analysis\n    - Improve data quality - filling the other 1000+ missing revenue value\n    - Require new related data - collecting more financial detail, filtering and classifing high value customers and implementing one-to-one customer service & relative reward plan for them","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c4b335df-afe0-4bce-a64b-00d5c7916453"},{"source":"","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b1e7cb83-72f9-47c7-8a6b-8b36d0ec6056"},{"source":"## ‚úÖ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
